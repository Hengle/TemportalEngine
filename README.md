# Temportal Engine

This is a "fun" side-project which explores various areas of game and game-engine development.

## Rendering

Vulkan 1.1.x (Apache License Version 2.0)

The first and largest hurdle of any good game is what the user can interact with and see. That means we definitely need some kind of graphics.
I decided to poke around at using Vulkan, as this projects intent was and continues to be to push myself to learn more.
Here are some resources for you (and myself) to get started with Vulkan!
- Vulkan SDK: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows (this will set the `VULKAN_SDK` system environment path, which is required for setup)
- LunarG Vulkan SDK Docs: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.2.135.0/windows/getting_started.html
- Vulkan-HPP: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp
- Vulkan SDK tutorial: https://vulkan-tutorial.com/en/Overview

Next Vulkan Task: Image Views & Buffers. Pick up at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/en/Drawing_a_triangle/Presentation/Image_views
